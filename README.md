# 🎭 Monster Opera – A Playful Singing Experiment 🎶  

Hey devs! 👋  

I just launched **Monster Opera** – a fun little web experiment where you can create your own **singing monster choir!** 🎤  
I wanted to build something **playful and UX-friendly**, making it easy and enjoyable to interact with.  

## 🪇 Tech Stack  
- 🚀 **Next.js** – for the frontend  
- 🎨 **Spline** – for interactive 3D models  
- 🎵 **Tone.js** – to handle sound generation  

## 💡 Why I Built This  
I wanted to merge **playfulness, music, and interactive web design** into an experience that's:  
**Simple** – no learning curve, just fun!  
**Intuitive** – easy to use with a smooth UI  
**Creative** – experiment with sounds and visuals
